# Pesky Tourist

This application is an introduction to the median filter used in image processing for removing noise, or in this case, a pesky tourist. The images located in img folder involves a tourist who keeps getting in the way of a sculpture that is being photographed. The tourist is essentially noise, which can be removed using the median filter. The images use the PPM image format since it is a text-based format.
